* 2 - run command "lessc scoped-bootstrap.less scoped-bootstrap.css"
* 3 - find "scoped-bootstrap html" in and replace it with "scoped-bootstrap--html"
* 4 - find "scoped-bootstrap body" and replace it with "scoped-bootstrap--body"
* 5 - "scoped-bootstrap.css" can be used now.
* 6 - don't forget to include it into the dist by running gulp task "doc-dev".
